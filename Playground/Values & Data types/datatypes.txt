Data Types in Python
What are literals?
Literals are a way of expressing a value. Computers don’t understand data like humans do.

For example, let’s say I tell you to buy 1 packet of A grade Washing Powder for the price of 40.0.

As a human you can understand that these two numbers are different:

the number of packets has to be a positive integer
the price can go into decimals
So, to express this difference to computers, we use literals.

Common Literals
Numeric Literals

Integer Literals: These are used to store positive and negative integers.
Eg, You can store someone’s age 23, the year they were born in 1994 or the number of students in your college 8243.
Integers can hold both positive and negative values but cannot store decimal values

Floating Point Literals: These are used to store those numbers which have decimal values.
Eg, the average temperature this week 32.7 or the value of pi to 3.14159. Float literals can also hold negative values

Text-based Literals

String Literals: These are used to store zero or more characters and we use double quotes or single quotes for them. Eg, "George"or 'Python'
Note: Early programmers sometimes get confused between 1,  1.0 and "1". These 3 are different literals. The first one is an integer, the second a float and the third a string. While we can add and subtract the integer for mathematical operations, we won’t get the same results with the string literal.
