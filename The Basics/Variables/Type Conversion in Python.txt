Type Conversion in Python
What is Type Conversion?
Type Conversion is the process of converting from one data type to another. This is not possible with all data types, since not all of them are compatible with one another.

For eg, we canâ€™t convert a string type to an int always, because it might contain some characters. But yes, we can convert an int to a float always because these are numeric types.

We use the following functions to convert a value into another type:

str() - to convert to a string
int() - to convert to an integer
float() - to convert to a decimal value
bool() - to convert to a boolean value
It converts any non-zero number to True. Converts zero to False
It converts any non-empty string to True. Converts empty string to False
Examples:

age = 5
decimal_age = float(age)
string_age = str(age)
string_age_2 = str(decimal_age)
 
legal = "Yes"
isLegal = bool(legal)
legal_2 = ""
isLegal2 = bool(legal_2)
 
print(age)
print(decimal_age)
print(string_age) # converted from int
print(string_age_2) # converted from float
print(isLegal) # converted from non-empty string
print(isLegal2) # converted from empty string
Output:

5
5.0
5
5.0
True
False
