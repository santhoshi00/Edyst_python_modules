What are operators?
Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.

We will have a look at the following operators:

Arithmetic Operators
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic Operators are used to do basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Operator	Description	Example	Result
+ (Addition)	Adds values on either side of the operator	20 + 10	30
- (Subtraction)	Subtracts right-hand operand from left-hand operand	20 - 10	10
* (Multiplication)	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	20 * 10	200
/ (Division)	Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand.	9 / 5	1.8
// (Integer Division)	Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and stores only integer part of divisor	9 / 5	1
% (Modulus)	Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and returns remainder	10 % 6	4
Here is how we use the operators in a program:

a = 20;
b = 10;
c = 8;
d = 6;
print("a + b =",(a + b) )
print("a - b =",(a - b) )
print("a * b =",(a * b) )
print("b / c =",(b / c) )
print("b // c =",(b // c) )
print("c % d =",(c % d) )
print("d % a =",(d % a) )
Output:

a + b = 30
a - b = 10
a * b = 200
b / c = 1.25
b // c = 1
c % d = 2
d % a = 6
Note: As in real life, division by 0 is not defined.

So when you run a Python program which has a divide by 0 statement, the Python program stops when it sees the divide by 0 command.
All the commands before this statement are executed.
